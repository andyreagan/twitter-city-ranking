These are the results of my best attempt to match Lewis's results.

I used `rankCities.py` where the I stopped the full list of words on each city:

```stop_words = ["atlantic", "grand", "green", "falls", "lake", "new", "santa", "haven", "battle", "nigga", "niggaz", "niggas", "nigger"]```

and I didn't use users who had more than 15% of the bot words:

```bot_words = ["battle","humid", "humidity", "pressure", "earthquake",]```

where the word *battle* seems to be a mistake.
